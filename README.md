|rl_clear_history|This function clears the entire history list maintained by Readline. The history list stores previously entered commands, and can be accessed using the arrow keys or other similar keybindings|

rl_on_new_line(): This function tells Readline that a new line of input is about to be entered. It is typically called after the user presses the Enter key to submit a command.

rl_replace_line(const char *text, int clear_undo): This function replaces the entire contents of the input line with the specified text. The clear_undo parameter determines whether the undo buffer should be cleared.

rl_redisplay(): This function updates the display to reflect changes made to the input line. It is typically called after rl_replace_line() to ensure that the new line of text is properly displayed.

These functions can be useful for implementing custom command-line interfaces, or for modifying the behavior of existing interfaces.
